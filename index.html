            <h4>What is Chowtime?</h4>
            <p>Chowtime is a simple web app that can be used to track your eating habits. Just click the button above whenever you start and stop eating. Then export the data and use it however you like, make some cool graphs or something idk. I initially created it to track my efforts in intermittent fasting.</p>
            <p>Please note that chowtime is in Alpha testing. Hopefully there won't be any major changes to the structuring of the data, but in the case where there is I will do my best to maintain compatability.</p>
            <h4>Can I change the entries?</h4>
            <p>Have you pressed the button by mistake or forgot to press it when you should have? Here at chowtime we don't condone mistakes. So will just have to do better next time. Chowtime is a tool that is used to build habits, if you slip up occasionally its really not going to skew the data that much and if you are needing to edit the data constantly then you are probably not using this tool the way that was intended.</p>
            <h4>How is my data stored?</h4>
            <p>Chowtime uses the browser's local storage. This means that your data never leaves your device and is yours to do with as you please. The only downside to this is that localstorage is wiped whenever you delete your local cache/history/app data.</p>
            <h4>How can I see my data?</h4>
            <p>Currently I am working on a <a href="visualize">visualization tool</a> (note that this will only work if you have at least 24 hours worth of entries and currently it only shows the last 31 days of activity) or you can export the data directly with <a href="#" id="link" download="eatingHistory.json">this link</a>.</p>
            <h4>Experimental Features?</h4>
            <p>Diary Mode <a id="diaryToggle" onclick="toggleDiary()" class="submit">OFF</a></p>
            <p>This allows you to record any additional information you want. These are time stamped and kept alongside your chowtime data. You could record how much sleep you got, things you eat, how you feel, current weight or anything else. Like this whole tool this feature is very experimental.</p>
